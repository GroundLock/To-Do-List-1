# To-Do List Application

Project for RoadMap
https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker

This is a simple Python-based command-line To-Do List application. It allows users to manage tasks by adding, updating, displaying, and deleting items from a task list. The data is stored persistently in a `data.json` file.

## Features
- Add new tasks to the to-do list.
- Update the status of tasks (e.g., In Progress, Done).
- View all tasks or filter tasks by status.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Save tasks persistently in a JSON file.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the program with the command:

   ```bash
   python to_do_list.py
   ```

4. Use the following commands to interact with the to-do list.
